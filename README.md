# DurableSolutions_simulation
Code to test different metric + indicator options for durable solutions to internal displacement


**To Do**
+ Write related note as an Rmarkdown to facilitate updating of numbers
+ Rewrite functions for increased efficiency (in particular for option 2!)
+ Implement a tracking of WHICH IDPs are classified as overcoming vulnerabilities (Do the different metric options identify the same IDPs as no longer vulnerable?)
+ Simulate synthetic data to test the metrics options and functions without empirical data (i.e. create enough indicators of varying "difficulty" to fully implement all options)
